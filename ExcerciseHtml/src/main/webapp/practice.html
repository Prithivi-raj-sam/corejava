    <h3>E Vehicles</h3>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
    During the late 20th and early 21st century,
    the environmental impact of the petroleum-based transportation
    infrastructure, along with the fear of peak oil,
    led to renewed interest in an electric transportation
    infrastructure. EVs differ from fossil fuel-powered
    vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated
    from a wide range of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power,
    and renewables such solar power and wind power or any combination
    of those. The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric
    vehicles varies depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity
    generation.
    
    <h3>Petrol Vehicles</h3>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    A petrol engine (British English and Australian English) or
    gasoline engine (American English) is an internal combustion engine
    with spark-ignition, designed to run on petrol (gasoline) and similar 
    volatile fuels.In most petrol engines, the fuel and air are usually 
    pre-mixed before compression (although some modern petrol engines 
    now use cylinder-direct petrol injection). The pre-mixing was formerly 
    done in a carburetor, but now it is done by electronically controlled 
    fuel injection, except in small engines where the cost/complication of 
    electronics does not justify the added engine efficiency.
    
    <h3>Diesel Vehicles</h3>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    The diesel engine, named after Rudolf Diesel,
    is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the 
    fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder 
    due to mechanical compression; thus, the diesel engine is a so-called 
    compression-ignition engine (CI engine). This contrasts with engines using 
    spark plug-ignition of the air-fuel mixture, such as a petrol engine 
    (gasoline engine) or a gas engine (using a gaseous fuel like natural gas or 
    liquefied petroleum gas).
